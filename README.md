## Why

A banner is a less common contorl, but on e that is usefull.  Since we did not have one in our control library, I tought it would be a good time to add one.

a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template but the code is the same wither it is Server side or client side.

1. Adding and removing style class on click events
